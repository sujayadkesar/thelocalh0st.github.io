## üß† RDP in Forensics 

Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is one of the most common entry points in Windows environments ‚Äî both for system administrators and malicious actors. Understanding the **chain of RDP-related Event IDs** allows defenders to reconstruct session activity, identify unauthorized access, and correlate logins, re-connections, and logoffs.

This blog post breaks down **key RDP events** and presents a **timeline-style visualization** of an RDP session lifecycle.

## üîê Successful Logon: The Forensic Breadcrumbs

When a valid RDP session is established, the following **Event IDs** are triggered:

| Event ID       | Description                   | Log Source             |
|----------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| 1149           | User authentication succeeded | `RemoteConnectionManager` |
| 4624 (Type 10/7)| Logon success                 | `Security.evtx`        |
| 21, 22         | Shell start / session logon   | `LocalSessionManager`  |

_RDP Successful Logon_


üß† *Tip:* Always correlate 1149 + 4624 for RDP logon confirmation. Type 10 (RemoteInteractive) is your smoking gun.

## üö´ Unsuccessful Logon Attempts

Threat actors love brute-force RDP attacks. Track failed logon attempts using:

| **Event ID** | **Description** | **Log Source** |
|--------------|------------------|----------------|
| 1149         | Attempt made (still triggers!) | `RemoteConnectionManager` |
| 4625         | Account failed to log on | `Security.evtx` |

üîç *Watch for high-frequency 4625s followed by a successful 4624 ‚Äî a sign of brute-force followed by success.*

## üîÅ RDP Session Reconnects & Disconnects

Sessions can disconnect due to idle timeouts or network blips. Here's how to track them:

| **Event ID** | **What Happened** | **Source** |
|--------------|-------------------|------------|
| 24, 40       | Session disconnected | `LocalSessionManager` |
| 4634         | Account logged off | `Security.evtx` |
| 4779         | Session disconnected from Window Station | `Security.evtx` |
| 25           | Session reconnection succeeded | `LSM` |
| 4778         | Session reconnected | `Security.evtx` |

üìå *Reason codes in Event 40 can indicate whether the disconnect was manual, idle timeout, or network loss.*

## üßæ RDP Logoff and Session End

The tail end of an RDP session logs final cleanup:

| **Event ID** | **Meaning** | **Source** |
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| 23           | Logoff success | `LSM` |
| 4647         | User initiated logoff | `Security.evtx` |
| 9009         | Desktop Window Manager exited | `System.evtx` |

üìé *Use Event 4647 to differentiate between user-initiated logoff vs. forced logoff.*

## üîß Practical Use Case: Detecting Suspicious RDP Behavior

Let‚Äôs say you see the following sequence:

1. Many `4625` failures for user `admin`
2. One successful `1149` + `4624` (Type 10)
3. A quick `4634` logoff

This could signal a **brute-force attack followed by immediate reconnaissance** and logoff.

Add contextual data like:
- Login time outside business hours
- Non-corporate IP address
- Unusual hostnames or session durations

## üé® RDP Timeline Visualization

Here's a conceptual timeline:

```
[00:00] -> Event 1149: Auth attempt  
[00:01] -> Event 4624: Success login (Type 10)  
[00:02] -> Event 21/22: Shell/session initiated  
[00:30] -> Event 40: Disconnected  
[00:31] -> Event 25: Reconnected  
[01:00] -> Event 4647: Logoff initiated  
[01:00] -> Event 9009: DWM closed  
```

üß≠ *Visual timelines like these help in threat hunting and post-incident investigations.*

## üîö Final Thoughts

RDP event forensics isn't just about detecting brute-force attacks ‚Äî it's about creating a narrative from logs. By correlating Event IDs across `Security.evtx`, `System.evtx`, and `TerminalServices` logs, you can **reconstruct attacker behavior with high fidelity**.
