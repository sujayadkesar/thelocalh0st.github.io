# GUI Execution Artifact - Program Compatibility Assistant 
![](/assets/images/pca-banner.png)
<br>
In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital forensics, the discovery of new artifacts is a rare and exciting event. Windows 11 version 22H2 introduced a **significant new forensic artifact** that has captured the attention of the DFIR (Digital Forensics and Incident Response) community: the **Program Compatibility Assistant (PCA) artifact**

## What is the PCA Artifact?

The **Program Compatibility Assistant (PCA)** is not entirely new to Windows â€“ it has existed since Windows Vista as a mechanism to detect and fix compatibility issues in legacy applications when they are executed on newer versions of Windows. However, what's revolutionary about Windows 11 22H2 is that the PCA service (`PcaSvc`) now **stores additional execution data** in text files, creating a new source of evidence for digital forensic investigators

This artifact provides **evidence of execution specifically for GUI-based programs**, making it a valuable addition to the forensic analyst's toolkit alongside traditional artifacts like Prefetch, Amcache, and ShimCache[2](https://aboutdfir.com/new-windows-11-pro-22h2-evidence-of-execution-artifact/)3.


## Artifact Location and Structure

The PCA artifact resides in the following directory:

`C:\Windows\appcompat\pca\` 

`This location contains three key files`

-   `PcaAppLaunchDic.txt`
-   `PcaGeneralDb0.txt`
-   `PcaGeneralDb1.txt`
    

## PcaAppLaunchDic.txt: The Primary Artifact

The most significant file for forensic analysis is **PcaAppLaunchDic.txt**.This pipe-delimited text file contains a simple but powerful format:

`[Full Executable Path] | [Last Execution Timestamp]` 
For example:
`C:\Program Files\Everything\Everything.exe|2022-12-28 16:06:24.212` 
![](/assets/images/1.png)

The timestamp represents the **last time the specified executable was executed** and is stored in **UTC format**. Importantly, this timestamp is recorded when the process **terminates**, not when it starts

## PcaGeneralDb0.txt: Extended Execution Details

The `PcaGeneralDb0.txt` file contains **more detailed information** about executed programs, including:

-   Runtime timestamp
    
-   Run status
    
-   Full path to the binary
    
-   Description of the file
    
-   Software vendor
    
-   File version
    
-   Program ID (which can be **cross-referenced with Amcache** for enhanced analysis

## PcaGeneralDb1.txt: Secondary Database

The `PcaGeneralDb1.txt` file appears to serve as a secondary database, though research indicates it may not always be populated or updated in all testing scenarios.

## Forensic Value and Analysis

## Evidence of Execution

The PCA artifact provides **reliable evidence of program execution** similar to other well-established artifacts like Prefetch and Amcache. This is particularly valuable for:

-   **Timeline analysis** of program execution
    
-   **Identifying malicious software** that has been run on a system
    
-   **Incident response investigations** where understanding program execution history is crucial
    
-   **Cross-referencing with other artifacts** for comprehensive analysis
    

## Integration with Existing Artifacts

One of the most powerful aspects of the PCA artifact is its ability to be **correlated with Amcache**. The Program ID field in `PcaGeneralDb0.txt` can be matched with Amcache entries, allowing investigators to create a more complete picture of program execution and installation history.

## Limitations and Considerations

While the PCA artifact is valuable, it's important to understand its limitations:

-   **Windows 11 22H2 specific**: This artifact only exists in Windows 11 version 22H2 and later.
-   **GUI programs only**: It primarily tracks graphical user interface applications
-   **Process termination timing**: Timestamps reflect when processes end, not when they begin
-   **Limited deployment**: As Windows 11 22H2 adoption is still growing (currently at 42.66% globally), this artifact may not be present in all investigations
    

## Practical Implementation

## Tool Support

The forensic community has quickly adapted to support this new artifact:

-   **Velociraptor** has developed specific artifacts for PCA analysis[6](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/idan-abramovich-b16a4211a_new-windows-11-pro-22h2-evidence-of-execution-activity-7320449133717155840-s6_H)
    
-   **KAPE** includes targets for collecting PCA files[7](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/KapeFiles/blob/master/Targets/Windows/AppCompatPCA.tkape)
    
-   Custom parsing tools have been developed by the community[8](http://windowsir.blogspot.com/2023/04/program-execution.html)
    

## Investigation Workflow

When analyzing PCA artifacts, forensic investigators should:

1.  **Collect all three PCA files** from the target system
    
2.  **Parse PcaAppLaunchDic.txt** for basic execution evidence
    
3.  **Analyze PcaGeneralDb0.txt** for detailed program information
    
4.  **Cross-reference with Amcache** using Program IDs
    
5.  **Integrate findings** into timeline analysis and case documentation
    

## Future Implications

The discovery of the PCA artifact represents a **significant advancement** in Windows forensics[1](https://www.sygnia.co/blog/new-windows-11-pca-artifact/). As Windows 11 22H2 becomes more prevalent in enterprise environments, this artifact will become increasingly valuable for:

-   **Incident response teams** investigating security breaches
    
-   **Malware analysis** and threat hunting activities
    
-   **Corporate investigations** requiring evidence of program execution
    
-   **Timeline reconstruction** in complex forensic cases
    

## Conclusion

The Windows 11 22H2 PCA artifact fills an important gap in digital forensics by providing **clear, text-based evidence of GUI program execution**[2](https://aboutdfir.com/new-windows-11-pro-22h2-evidence-of-execution-artifact/). Its simple format makes it easily parseable, while its integration capabilities with existing artifacts like Amcache enhance its investigative value[1](https://www.sygnia.co/blog/new-windows-11-pca-artifact/)[6](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/idan-abramovich-b16a4211a_new-windows-11-pro-22h2-evidence-of-execution-activity-7320449133717155840-s6_H).

As the digital forensics community continues to research and develop tools for this artifact, it promises to become a **cornerstone of Windows 11 forensic analysis**[9](https://www.techzine.eu/blogs/security/114162/digging-deeper-into-software-artifacts/). For DFIR professionals, understanding and leveraging the PCA artifact will be essential as Windows 11 deployment continues to expand across enterprise environments.

The discovery and documentation of this artifact by researchers like Andrew Rathbun and Lucas Gonzalez, along with continued research by teams at Sygnia, demonstrates the importance of **ongoing forensic research** in keeping pace with evolving operating systems and their investigative potential[1](https://www.sygnia.co/blog/new-windows-11-pca-artifact/)[2](https://aboutdfir.com/new-windows-11-pro-22h2-evidence-of-execution-artifact/).
