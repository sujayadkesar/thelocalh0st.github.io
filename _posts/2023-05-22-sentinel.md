### Step 2: Azure Sentinel Activation

Calling all superheroes! Azure Sentinel is here to save the day. Activate Azure Sentinel, our very own defender against threats and the ultimate Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution.



### Step 3: Unleashing the Windows Server 2016 Beast

Release the beast! We'll spin up a Windows Server 2016-based virtual machine in our lab. This server will be our target for monitoring and detecting all the sneaky security incidents.



## Lab Experience

### 1. Monitoring TOR Activity

Time to play detective! We'll monitor TOR (The Onion Router) activity on our Windows Server 2016. Azure Sentinel will be our trusty partner, helping us detect any suspicious TOR-related shenanigans.

### 2. Creating a Watchlist

Let's level up our threat detection skills! We'll create a watchlist with a whopping 2,600 TOR nodes. Azure Sentinel will keep an eye on any interactions with these nodes, making us the superheroes of threat intelligence.



### 3. Utilizing KQL Queries

Get your detective hats on, folks! Azure Sentinel speaks KQL (Kusto Query Language), our secret weapon for analyzing log data. We'll craft custom queries, filter data like pros, and generate awesome visualizations to spot those elusive threats.
