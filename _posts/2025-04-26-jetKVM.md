## Are Hardware KVMs the Next Big Blind Spot in Digital Forensics??

**JetKVM:** A $70 hardware KVM device that grants anyone full remote control of a computer-**even when powered off or locked**-via HDMI/USB emulation. No host software. No traditional forensic traces. Just pure hardware-level access.

## When Your Keyboard Is the Attacker 

>  A Forensics Wake-Up Call!!
{: .prompt-warning }


-   **Invisible to EDR/XDR**: Operates as a "Dell Monitor" or "Logitech Keyboard" in registries USBSTOR entries blend with legitimate hardware
       
-   **Zero Memory Footprint**: Leaves no process/network artifacts (unlike RDP/VNC)
    

## **The Forensic Blind Spot**

-   **Registry Traces**: Spoofed vendor IDs in `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USB` may be your only lead
-   **Network Red Flags**: WebRTC traffic to `jetkvmcloud.com` (ports 3478-3481) if attackers use their cloud service

-   **Physical Evasion**: Smaller than a keylogger and hides behind monitor cables

## Our Observatiosn on Jet-KVM

After purchasing and testing JetKVM for forensic analysis, here‚Äôs what I discovered:

1. **Fully Customizable Device Identity**  
   JetKVM appears to the system as just another external monitor or keyboard. Even more concerning, you can *customize* the device name, serial number, and other identifiers ‚Äî so it could show up as ‚ÄúDell Monitor,‚Äù ‚ÄúLogitech Keyboard,‚Äù or virtually anything you want in system registries and device managers.

2. **Persistence Across Reboots and BIOS Access**  
   Remote control via JetKVM *persists even after a system reboot* and is available during BIOS/UEFI setup. The device acts exactly like a local keyboard and monitor, allowing an attacker to change BIOS settings or boot order ‚Äî no operating system needed.

3. **EDID Cloning for Perfect Disguise**  
   We took it a step further: by extracting and decoding the EDID (Extended Display Identification Data) from the host machine‚Äôs built-in display, converting it to hex, and uploading it to the JetKVM dashboard, we made JetKVM perfectly mimic the original display.  
   The system recognized it as the *exact same* built-in monitor, with matching name, serial number, vendor ID, and other attributes ‚Äî making forensic differentiation nearly impossible.
<br>
   Furthermore we tried to get the EDID of the built-in display and mimic and it perfectly worked out!!! as shwon in the screenshots below.

## **The Forensic Blind Spot**

- **Registry Traces**: Spoofed vendor IDs can only be found under `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USB` ‚Äî and even then, they can be made to look legitimate.
- **Network Red Flags**: `ONLY if the person using JetKVM's cloud features`, we will be able to  observe outbound WebRTC traffic to `jetkvmcloud.com` 
- **Physical Evasion**: The device is tiny  and easily hides behind monitor cables or docks.

    

## **The Bigger Picture**

This isn‚Äôt just about JetKVM-**hardware-based threats are evolving**. Think:

-   Offline data theft via rogue charging stations.
    
-   Supply chain attacks with pre-installed KVMs in "new" hardware.

## üõ°Ô∏è Special Thanks
This research wouldn't have been possible without the amazing support of my friend [Akhil Dara](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akhil-dara/) ‚Äî
who not only helped in purchasing the JetKVM device from US but also the in conducting forensic tests,
