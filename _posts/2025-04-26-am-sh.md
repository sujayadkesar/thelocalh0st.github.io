## Are Hardware KVMs the Next Big Blind Spot in Digital Forensics??

**JetKVM:** A $70 hardware KVM device that grants anyone full remote control of a computer-**even when powered off or locked**-via HDMI/USB emulation. No host software. No traditional forensic traces. Just pure hardware-level access.

## When Your Keyboard Is the Attacker 

>  A Forensics Wake-Up Call!!
{: .prompt-warning }


-   **Invisible to EDR/XDR**: Operates as a "Dell Monitor" or "Logitech Keyboard" in registries USBSTOR entries blend with legitimate hardware
       
-   **Zero Memory Footprint**: Leaves no process/network artifacts (unlike RDP/VNC)
    

## **The Forensic Blind Spot**

-   **Registry Traces**: Spoofed vendor IDs in `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USB` may be your only lead
-   **Network Red Flags**: WebRTC traffic to `jetkvmcloud.com` (ports 3478-3481) if attackers use their cloud service

-   **Physical Evasion**: Smaller than a keylogger and hides behind monitor cables

### How do you detect ???

    

## **The Bigger Picture**

This isn‚Äôt just about JetKVM-**hardware-based threats are evolving**. Think:

-   Offline data theft via rogue charging stations.
    
-   Supply chain attacks with pre-installed KVMs in "new" hardware.
