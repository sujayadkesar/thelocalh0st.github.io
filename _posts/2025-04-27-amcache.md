## 📌 Introduction

In Windows forensics, **Amcache.hve** has earned a reputation as a valuable artifact for tracking program executions. Many incident responders and forensic analysts quickly parse Amcache and assume that the **timestamps** reflect the exact moment a program was executed.

But what if I told you that **this assumption is fundamentally wrong**?

In this blog, we’ll dig deep into **how Amcache actually works**, **how data gets populated into it**, and **why relying on Amcache timestamps alone can be misleading**. I'll also share a real-world test I conducted that shows exactly why **Amcache should not be trusted for precise execution times**.

----------

## 📚 What is Amcache.hve?

**Amcache.hve** is a registry hive located at:
`C:\Windows\AppCompat\Programs\Amcache.hve` 

Its primary purpose is **not forensic tracking**, but **application compatibility**. Windows collects information about executed applications to:

-   Assess application behavior for OS upgrades.
    
-   Help with compatibility issues during Windows updates.
    
-   Inventory installed or run programs.
    

The key thing to remember is:

> **Amcache was designed for system performance and compatibility, not real-time execution monitoring.**

----------

## ⚙️ How Does Data Get Into Amcache?

Most people believe that when an executable is run, its details are instantly recorded into Amcache. **That is not true.**

Behind the scenes, Windows uses a scheduled task called **Microsoft Compatibility Appraiser** to scan the system and update the Amcache database.

-   **Location in Task Scheduler:**  
    `Task Scheduler > Microsoft > Windows > Application Experience > Microsoft Compatibility Appraiser`
    
-   **How it works:**
    
    -   It runs on a scheduled basis (daily or during idle times).
        
    -   It scans installed and executed programs.
        
    -   It updates Amcache.hve based on its findings.
        

⚡ **Important:**  
Until the **Microsoft Compatibility Appraiser** task runs, newly executed programs **do not appear in Amcache.hve**.

This introduces a delay — sometimes of **hours**, **days**, or even **weeks** — between the _execution_ of a file and its _entry_ into Amcache.

----------

## ⚠️ Common Misconceptions About Amcache

Here are some misconceptions I've seen repeatedly:
![](/assets/images/table.png)
So if you are parsing Amcache and reporting exact execution times based on its fields like `FirstRunTime` or `ProgramIdLastModifiedTime`, **you might be misrepresenting the evidence**.

----------

## 🧪 Real-World Experiment: Proving the Flaw

To test how Amcache behaves, I conducted a controlled experiment:

## Experiment:

-   **April 15:**  
    I executed a **malicious EXE** on a Windows machine.
    
-   **Before Midnight (April 15):**  
    I manually **shut down** the system.  
    (Remember, the Compatibility Appraiser was scheduled to run at midnight.)
    
-   **April 27:**  
    After a long time, I **powered on** the system and **manually triggered** the Compatibility Appraiser task.
    
-   **Observation:**
    
    -   The malicious EXE I had executed on **April 15** showed up in Amcache **with a timestamp of April 27**.
        
    -   No artifact tied it to the original execution date.
        



**💥 Result:**  
Amcache timestamp **reflected the time the Appraiser ran**, not when the file was executed!

This clearly proves that **Amcache cannot be used alone to determine the exact time of execution**.

## 🛠️ How to Parse Amcache.hve 

There are several tools available to parse Amcache:

-   [Eric Zimmerman's AmcacheParser](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/AmcacheParser)
   
    


But **always** remember:  
⚡ **"Timestamps reflect discovery time, not guaranteed execution time."**

----------




## ✍️ Final Thoughts

**Amcache is a valuable artifact** — but like any tool, **you must understand its limitations** to use it correctly.

Blindly trusting Amcache timestamps can lead to **wrong conclusions** in forensic investigations.  
Understanding the background process — the **Microsoft Compatibility Appraiser** — is crucial for accurate timeline analysis.

## 🎯**Key takeaway:**

> **Artifacts are storytellers — but not every storyteller tells the truth in the moment.**

>  Amcache should be used as **one puzzle piece**, not the full story.
