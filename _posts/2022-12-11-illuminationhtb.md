   |-------bot.js
  ```

``` cat config.json```
```

        "token": "Replace me with token when in use! Security Risk!",
        "prefix": "~",
        "lightNum": "1337",

        "host": "127.0.0.1"
}
```

Hmmm, that top line is interesting. The token has been replaced for a security risk. There is a chance a developer has left this in the git logs. That’s what we can look at next. To do this just traverse in the terminal into the folder holding the `.git`. This is what you’ll see when you use the command:

```sh
git log
```
