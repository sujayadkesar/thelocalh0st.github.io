[HackTheBox / Meow - STARTING-POINT](https://app.hackthebox.com/starting-point)

-------------------

## Setting-up VPN

step-1: Download the starting-point vpn file
step-2: Open terminal and navigated to the downloaded directory (cd ~/Downloads)
step-3: sudo openvpn {filename.ovpn}

note: run this vpn file in diffrent windows for better experience and run this script untill you see **initial sequence completed**

step-4 open terminal in another window and you can check the connectivity by pinging the ip address

## Tasks
Task 1: What does the acronym VM stands for?
```
virtual machine
```
Task 2: What tool do we use to interact with the operating system in order to issue commands via the command line, such as the one to start our VPN connection? It's also known as a console or shell.
```
terminal
```
Task 3: What service do we use to form our VPN connection into HTB labs?
```
openvpn
```
Task 4: What is the abbreviated name for a 'tunnel interface' in the output of your VPN boot-up sequence output?
```
tun
```
Task 5: What tool do we use to test our connection to the target with an ICMP echo request?
```
ping
```
Task 6: What is the name of the most common tool for finding open ports on a target?
```
nmap
```


## Enumeration

```
sudo nmap -sV -sC {target-ip}
```
> -sV ---> service version detection
> -sC ---> software version detection


Nmap scan results:
```sh
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-12-08 01:02 EST
Nmap scan report for 10.129.96.82
Host is up (0.22s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
23/tcp open  telnet  Linux telnetd
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 24.63 seconds
```


Hmm, We can see that only 1 port is open that is telnet on 23
Let's exploit using telnet!! if you are not sure what telnet is click here to do [a quick google sesarch](https://www.google.com/search?q=telnet)

Task 7: What service do we identify on port 23/tcp during our scans?
```
telnet
```

## exploit telnet


```sh
telnet {target-ip}
```

We will need to find some credentials that work to continue since there are no other ports open on the
target that we could explore :)

Some typical important accounts have self-explanatory names, such as: 

 - [ ] admin
 - [ ] administrator
 - [ ] root

Let's try it out one by one  (press enter for password as we are looking for blank password)


Task 8: What username is able to log into the target over telnet with a blank password?
```
root
```



## We got the flag!!!
you can see that you are now root user of Meow machine **root@Meow**

type **ls** command to view the files inside the present directory
type **cat flag.txt** to display the flag

## SUBMIT ROOT FLAG
