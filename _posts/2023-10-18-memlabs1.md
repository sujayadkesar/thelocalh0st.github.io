## **Challenge Description** 
> My sister’s computer crashed. We were very fortunate to recover this memory dump. Your job is get all her important files from the system. From what we remember, we suddenly saw a black window pop up with some thing being executed. When the crash happened, she was trying to draw something. Thats all we remember from the time of crash.

The first thing to do with a memory dump file is to identify the operating system, for that we use  `imageinfo`  plugin.

```
$ volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab1.raw imageinfo

```

![1](https://github.com/thelocalh0st/thelocalh0st.github.io/assets/125783410/cf640d3d-5b3a-44d1-a881-02610155b406)


Next we check the running processes using  `pslist`  plugin.

```
$ volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab1.raw --profile Win7SP1x64 pslist

```
![2](https://github.com/thelocalh0st/thelocalh0st.github.io/assets/125783410/513f8c1c-61bc-409c-8744-1a6fd4d7760b)



There are 3 interesting processes here, let’s start with  `cmd.exe`. This process indicates that commands were executed on the system.

We can use  `consoles`  plugin to see the output

```
$ volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab1.raw --profile Win7SP1x64 consoles

```

![3](https://github.com/thelocalh0st/thelocalh0st.github.io/assets/125783410/eea18bdb-fd2d-42a6-9442-0e630333b301)

If you look closely to the output of the command  `St4G3$1`, you can spot some  `Base64`  text. If we decode it we get the flag of stage 1.

```
$ echo ZmxhZ3t0aDFzXzFzX3RoM18xc3Rfc3Q0ZzMhIX0= | base64 -d
flag{th1s_1s_th3_1st_st4g3!!}

```
<br>
<br>

> #### Flag 1: flag{th1s_1s_th3_1st_st4g3!!}

Next we will focus on the second interesting process, which is  `mspaint.exe`. The PID of this process is `2424`

If you go back to the challenge description, we can see that the user was drawing something using mspaint

So let’s use  `memdump`  plugin to extract some data.

```
$ volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab1.raw --profile Win7SP1x64 memdump -p 2424 -D lab1_output/

```

The output is written to  `2424.dmp`, we need to rename it to  `2424.data`  to be able to open it in Gimp.

After playing a bit with the width and offset. I got an image which is somewhat flipped. I rotated it 180 degrees then flipped it horizontally and I got the flag.

> #### Flag 2: flag{G00d_Boy_good_girL}

The third interesting process is  `WinRAR.exe`  with `PID 1512`, we can use  `cmdline`  plugin to see the associated command line.

```
$ volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab1.raw --profile Win7SP1x64 cmdline | grep WinRAR
Volatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.6.1
WinRAR.exe pid:   1512
Command line : "C:\Program Files\WinRAR\WinRAR.exe" "C:\Users\Alissa Simpson\Documents\Important.rar"

```

Great, we got the name of the rar file which is  `Important.rar`  (looks important).

Next we can use  `filescan`  plugin to get the psychical offset of that file in memory.

```
$ volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab1.raw --profile Win7SP1x64 filescan | grep Important.rar
Volatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.6.1
0x000000003fa3ebc0      1      0 R--r-- \Device\HarddiskVolume2\Users\Alissa Simpson\Documents\Important.rar
0x000000003fac3bc0      1      0 R--r-- \Device\HarddiskVolume2\Users\Alissa Simpson\Documents\Important.rar
0x000000003fb48bc0      1      0 R--r-- \Device\HarddiskVolume2\Users\Alissa Simpson\Documents\Important.rar

```

We can pick any of these offsets, To dump the file we can use  `dumpfiles`  plugin.

```
$ volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab1.raw --profile Win7SP1x64 dumpfiles -Q 0x000000003fa3ebc0 -D lab1_output/
Volatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.6.1
DataSectionObject 0x3fa3ebc0   None   \Device\HarddiskVolume2\Users\Alissa Simpson\Documents\Important.rar

```

The file is dumped under the name  `file.None.0xfffffa8001034450.dat`, let’s rename and unrar it.

```
$ mv file.None.0xfffffa8001034450.dat Important.rar
$ unrar e Important.rar

Extracting from Important.rar

Password is NTLM hash(in uppercase) of Alissa's account passwd.

Enter password (will not be echoed) for flag3.png: 

```

The file is password protected, but we can see a comment that says the password is the NTLM hash of Alissa’s account passwd.

To get the password hash, we can use  `hashdump`  plugin.

```
$ volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab1.raw --profile Win7SP1x64 hashdump
Volatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.6.1

> Windows stores two hashes with each password, delimited by colons. The first one is an extremely insecure, obsolete hash using the LANMAN algorithm. Windows operating systems since Vista no longer use LANMAN hashes, so they are filled with a dummy value starting with “aad”.
> 
> The second hash is the newer NTLM hash, which is much better than LANMAN hashes, but still extremely insecure and much more easily cracked than Linux or Mac OS X hashes.

The desired NTLM hash is  `f4ff64c8baac57d22f22edc681055ba6`  (remember it must be in uppercase).

After decompressing the file, we get an image with the flag.
